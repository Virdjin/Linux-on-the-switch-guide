# Linux on switch
## Part one
Hello, there's a couple prerequisites before we start the guide. First, you need a hack switch and I can link you a guide on here if you don't already have one or I could potentially make one down the line. I'll leave a link to the guide right here. We need to get a special distro for the Nintendo switch called "LT4 switchroot". [Guide](https://switch.homebrew.guide/gettingstarted/beforestarting.html)  [L4T Distro](https://download.switchroot.org/ubuntu/)

## Part two
You can use your same SD card or a separate sd with 10 or more GB for both. And, the jig that you still have from the guide.

## Part 3
Okay so we're going to use here on our switch is "Hakate". It's nice all purpose tool that you can do cool tricks with. But we're going to be installing Linux with it. If you want you can do the same thing the same way with Android.

## Part 4
We're going to start with putting the SD card into the computer if it's not already in.
Then,copying everything from one folder to another and we're going to be using that copy for later on (Highly recommend naming the folder).If it's a new sd card you must copy your atmosphere folder to the new sd card.

## Part 5
Next we start by booting the switch into Hakate Then, go to the top of the screen where it says "tools" and go to where it says “partition SD card”

Once there, we'll have to select the amount of memory that you would like to use with Linux. That being said, I only used 10gb.

## Part 6
Back to the PC 
Now,remember that folder that I said to copy. We're going to need to restore all the files so I can go back to how it used to be. With the addition to those files, now get the special distro for the switch and just unzip the file and drag and drop to the root of the SD card.
Now back to Hakate. We go back to the Partition page and it should say "Flash Linux" on the bottom left.

Now back to the home screen of hekate and go to "More Configs" and then “L4T Ubuntu Bionic” should be right there.

Just your set up your Linux and we should be good to go for part two
